# The default_config module automatically gets imported by Appconfig, if it
# exists. See https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-appconfig for details.

# Note: Don't *ever* do this in a real app. A secret key should not have a
#       default, rather the app should fail if it is missing. For the sample
#       application, one is provided for convenience.
