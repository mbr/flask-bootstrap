Why do I have undesired auto-escapes in my template output?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Make sure your templates end in ``.htm``, ``.html``, ``.xml`` or ``.xhtml``.
Flask sets the Jinja2-autoescape mode depending on the template file extension
(see `this StackOverflow question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13222925
/how-do-i-enable-autoescaping-in-templates-with-a-jhtml-extension-in-flask>`_
for more information).

General convention in Flask applications is to name your HTML-templates
``.html`` though.


How can I add custom javascript to the template?
------------------------------------------------
.. highlight:: jinja

Use Jinja2's super_ in conjunction with the ``scripts`` block.
The super-function adds the contents of a block from the parent template, that
way you can even decide if you want to include it before or after
jQuery/bootstrap.
Example::


  {% block scripts %}
    {{super()}}
    <script src="my_app_code.js">
  {% endblock %}


Why is Bootstrap javascript not loading?
----------------------------------------

An easy-to-miss quirk are the block names: While there is a block named
``body``, it usually is not the one you want to replace, use ``content``
instead. Currently, javascript is `loaded at the end
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-is-the-best-place-to-put-
script-tags-in-html-markup>`_ of the ``<body>`` tag by default ).

:ref:`block-names` has more details.


How do I add custom stuff to the header?
----------------------------------------

A question that often pops up is how to add custom things to the ``<head>``
element, like ``<link>``-tags or favicons. This is also easily achieved using
the super_ function::

  {% block head %}
  {{super()}}
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="http://example.com/myicon.png">
  {% endblock %}

This will add the desired content just above the closing ``</head>`` tag.
Another way for larger projects is creating a new base template and adding
the required blocks yourself::

  {% block head %}
  {{super()}}
  {% block favicon %}<!-- default favicon could go here -->{% endblock %}
  {% block feeds %}{% endblock %}
  {% endblock %}

A child template of this base template can then use these blocks to specify
a custom feed or favicon.


How do I add a footer?
----------------------

The ``super()`` function can also be used to extend any block that is already
defined. It is usually a good idea to create another derived base template for
certain layouts. An example ``with-footer.html``::


    {% extends "bootstrap/base.html" %}

    {%- block content %}
    {{super()}}
    {%- block footer %}
    <footer>&copy; 2016 Awesome, Inc.</footer>
    {%- endblock footer %}
    {%- endblock content %}

The ``footer``-block can be overriden in all templates that extend from
``with-footer.html``.


How do I serve the static files in deployment?
----------------------------------------------

Flask-Bootstrap is not special in the sense that it simply adds a blueprint
named ``bootstrap``. The static files map to a specific URL-prefix (per default
``static/bootstrap``) and are served from a specific directory found in your
virtualenv installation (e.g. ``lib/python2.7/site-
packages/flask_bootstrap/static``), so a traditional setup would be setting up
your webserver to serve this address from the mentioned directory.

A more elegant approach is having a cache in front of the WSGI server that
respects ``Cache-Control`` headers. Per default, Flask will serve static files
with an expiration time of 12 hours (you can change this value using the
``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT``), which should be sufficient.

For this approach `nginx <http://nginx.org>`_ (or, if you prefer, `Varnish <http
://varnish-cache.org>`_) or their cloud-service based equivalents should
suffice. Flask-Bootstrap 2.3.2.2 supports this by offering querystring revving
(see ``BOOTSTRAP_QUERYSTRING_REVVING``) to ensure newer Bootstrap versions are
served when you upgrade Flask-Bootstrap.


How do I use Bootstrap 2/3?
---------------------------
.. highlight:: python

The current major stable version of Bootstrap is 3, which unfortunately is
backwards incompatible with Bootstrap 2. Flask-Bootstrap is maintained for
the latest version of Bootstrap 2 (although you should not expect new
features, only bug fixes) and, of course, Bootstrap 3.

By installing Flask-Bootstrap, you will always get the latest version, which
is Bootstrap 3. To install (or keep) Flask-Bootstrap 2, you will have to
specify the version in your ``setup.py`` or ``requirements.txt`` like this::

  # other stuff in setup.py
  # ...
  install_requires=['flask-bootstrap<3', 'another_package']
  # ...

It's not a bad idea to pin to a specific Flask-Bootstrap (e.g.    ``'flask-
bootstrap==2.3.2.2'`` to avoid surprises in production).

See the :doc:`bootstrap2` documentation for details.


Where is FontAwesome?
---------------------
.. highlight:: jinja

Versions of Flask-Bootstrap using Bootstrap 2 included FontAwesome_, this is no longer the case for Flask-Bootstrap 3 and higher.

Originally, Bootstrap did come only with image-based icons that did not scale
well, FontAwesome fixed this by providing vector-based replacements, as well as
additional icons. However, starting with Bootstrap 3 icons were included as a
font again, for this reason FontAwesome was dropped from the extension to
simplify things.

Today, FontAwesome_ is not the only choice, a comparison of available
alternatives is `available on the web
<http://tagliala.github.io/vectoriconsroundup/>`_.

If you still want to use FontAwesome, it's easy to include it by adding it to
the styles block inside your template derived base template::

  {% block styles -%}
  {{super()}}
  <link href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.0.3/css/font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet">
  {% endblock styles %}

.. _jquery-faq:

Why are you shipping jQuery 3 instead of jQuery 1?
--------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 dropped IE8 and IE9 support.
The only advantage of jQuery 1 was the older browser support (IE6-8).
`jQuery 3.0 <https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/>`_ is the future of jQuery.

If you need IE8-9 support, you should use Bootstrap v3 and jQuery 1.12.


How can I use jQuery1 instead of jQuery3?
-----------------------------------------

.. highlight:: python

You can use Flask-Bootstrap's CDN support to enable loading these resources
from a different source::

  from flask_bootstrap import WebCDN
  app.extensions['bootstrap']['cdns']['jquery'] = WebCDN(
      '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/'
  )

This will load ``jquery.js`` or whatever is required from the WebCDN specified.
If you prefer to ship your own local version of jQuery, you can similarly use
the following snippet::

    from flask_bootstrap import StaticCDN
    app.extensions['bootstrap']['cdns']['jquery'] = StaticCDN()

Note that in this case you need to download a suitable ``jquery.js`` and/or
``jquery.min.js`` and put it into your apps ``static``-folder.

All of the above setups will cause the ``BOOTSTRAP_SERVE_LOCAL``-option to be
ignored for jQuery as well. If you need a more complicated setup support the
option, have a look at the source of ``init_app`` and the docs of :doc:`cdn`.
