Here is an example::

this fork is just here for the parts of the file structure and visabilty we dont need a blueprint to hold a single hosted api. if i was going to add a bsd clause i would make it a versatal product not a roadblocks plugin attempt at injecting telemetry into pages with image and api loads etc. the buck ends here sir ill git dif your repo into a hash table that will result in dmca rain lol. im mad at all the security "backdoors" i have found in this repo sorry for the rant... but you dont stay a #1 roadblock creator without offering telemetry.
