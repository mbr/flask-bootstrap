{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
   Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom
   one for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects.

   Deriving from bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffoling.

   You can find additional information about template inheritance at

{# We also set a default title, usually because we might forget to set one.
   In our sample app, we will most likely just opt not to change it #}

{# While we are at it, we also enable fixes for legacy browsers. First we
   import the necessary macros: #}
{% import "bootstrap/fixes.html" as fixes %}

{# Then, inside the head block, we apply these. To not replace the header,
   ``super()`` is used: #}
{% block head %}
{{super()}}

   The sample application already contains the required static files. #}
