{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
   Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom
   one for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects.

   Deriving from bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffoling.

   You can find additional information about template inheritance at

{# We also set a default title, usually because we might forget to set one.
   In our sample app, we will most likely just opt not to change it #}
{% block title %}Sample App for Flask-Bootstrap{% endblock %}

{# While we are at it, we also enable fixes for legacy browsers. First we
   import the necessary macros: #}
{% import "bootstrap/fixes.html" as fixes %}

{# Then, inside the head block, we apply these. To not replace the header,
   ``super()`` is used: #}
{% block head %}
{{super()}}

{#- Docs: http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/macros.html#fixes
   The sample application already contains the required static files. #}
{{fixes.ie8()}}

{# Adding our own CSS files is also done here. Check the documentation at
   http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html#available-blocks
   for an overview. #}
{% block styles -%}
    {{super()}}  {# do not forget to call super or Bootstrap's own stylesheets
                    will disappear! #}

{# Finally, round things out with navigation #}
